        <p><b>Nyan Cat</b> is an animated cartoon cat with a Pop-Tart body that leaves trail rainbow trail when flying.
              It originated from a youtube video posted in 2011 which combined the animation with a Japanese pop song by Hatsune Miku.
              The character was created by Christian Torres via a GIF animation and Youtuber saraj00n combined the GIF with the song 
              Nyanyan by Hatsune Miku and uploaded it to Youtube shortly after.
              Nyan Cat's original name was simply "Pop Tart Cat" but was dubbed "Nyan Cat" named after the song.
              The creator later accepted the name change due its catchiness.
