                <h2><b>Sonic Adventure</b></h2>
                <p> is a platform video game created by SEGA. It was released in December 1998, one month after 
                    the SEGA Dreamcast was released in Japan. It became the best selling game for the Dreamcast with over 2.5 million copies 
                    released world wide. It gained a lot of populairty for being one of the first Sonic games in 3D. After the discontinuation
                    of the SEGA Dreamcast, the spirit of the game would continue to live on with it being ported to the Nintnedo gamecube. This 
                    version of the game would be called Sonic Adventure DX which includes updated graphics and even recieved a sequel which
                    debuted the popular character, Shadow the Hedgehog.
                </p>
                <p> Sonic Adventure differentiates itself from the previous games with the titular character being noticibly older and the story 
                    taking place on Earth rather than Sonic's fictional universe where anthromorphic animals serve as the dominant species. The game
                    begins with an unidentiable creature called Chaos attacking the city where Sonic is having a vacation. Sonic tries to stop it and learns it is a 
                    creation of his arch nemisis, Dr Robotinik (or Eggman). Sonic and his friends would have to collect the chaos emeralds to prevent 
                    Dr Robotinik from taking over the world.
